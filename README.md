# Prescription-Label-Reading
Extract the text data from the  prescriptions and convert them into speech.

Problem Statement:
Support elderly or vulnerable patients should be a focus for many businesses. This is 
especially true for those in the health care sector. Enabling voice messages can make it 
easier for elderly people to understand your message. Text-to-Speech can provide peace 
of mind by empowering you to give better services. For example, you could even send 
voice messages that read prescription labels.
This can be a real challenge for anyone with reading difficulties, not to mention the elderly 
and visually impaired. A talking label, sent straight to your device, makes it easy to know 
everything about your medication. Dosage info can also be tracked and shared with 
caregivers.


Approach: You need to apply OCR techniques to extract the text data from the prescriptions and convert them into speech.
